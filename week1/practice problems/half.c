// You are to complete the function, half, which calculates exactly half of the bill after tax and tip are added, and returns that value.
// Your function should use the input parameters, bill, tax, and tip, to calculate the final amount. However, since these values are 
// percentages, youâ€™ll have to do some work to convert these to more appropriate formats to use for your calculation.
// The tax should be added to the bill amount before calculating the tip. Finally, you will return exactly half of the full amount, 
// including the bill amount, the tax and the tip.
